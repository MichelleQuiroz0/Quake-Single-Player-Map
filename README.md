# Sacrilege Temple - Quake Single Player Map

Creating and editing a Quake map for single player mode. I will use a theme to help narrate the level, design architecture, props and set enemies.

The Sacrilege Temple was a peaceful sanctuary for many to come and pray. Now the temple is overrun by monsters who desecrate it for the purpose of summoning their leader. 
Chosen from a prophecy, the player will go through the rooms of this European church styled temple to cleanse the temple and stop the ritual.
